        During my internship, I had the valuable experience of working closely
        with a team, where I actively contributed to frontend development in a
        project. I collaborated with colleagues to implement frontend features
        using technologies like Next.js and React Native. This hands-on
        experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the
        importance of teamwork and effective communication in delivering
        successful projects!
